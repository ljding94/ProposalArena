build proposal score:

prompt:
ok, cool, now based on the outline.md and the reviewer_score_prompt.txt, let's write a function to score proposals (input proposal numbers, folder)  using llm, we should write the setup_llm.py script to setup llm using openrouter ( I already have api), and the output should be a list of output md files storing the output from the llm scorer using the yaml format, so we can easily read the score from these reviewer md files later.
